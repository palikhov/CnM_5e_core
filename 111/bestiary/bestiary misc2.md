## Eelfolk

Eelfolk are a piscine race with rubbery skin and patterned coloration meant to provide camouflage amid shifting underwater light. They slink and hunt through caves and shoals, carving out territory in bursts of aggressive expansion. Eelfolk often lair along shorelines and submerged caverns, never too far from the surface where they must occasionally gulp great mouthfuls of air.

**Ambushers**. Eelfolk keep to the fringes of the sea and ambush any who encroach upon their territory. While hunting, they prefer to lie in wait for prey to draw close before lunging out to attack. Two pouches behind their necks generate an electrical charge they use to sense their quarry, even in the murkiest depths.

**Storm Worshippers**. Eelfolk worship the squalls of the sea as though they were gods, viewing all storms as divinely inspired. Sailors at sea have reported seeing dozens of eelfolk cavorting through the water during tempests.

**Growing Pains**. Eelfolk grow larger and more powerful with age, shifting from stealthy hunters to vicious brutes. Fully matured eelfolk grow extra electrical pouches that cover their bodies in crackling energy. These scourges are more cunning and aggressive than their younger brethren. They lead surprise raids along shoreline settlements in order to satiate their ever-growing hunger for violence and food.

**Storm's Fury**. During raging ocean storms, the strongest and most cunning eelfolk fight with each other to throw themselves in the path of a lightning strike. Rarely, one lucky creature will be enveloped in a great blast of energy. The lighting burns the eelfolk's bulky body away, replacing it with a gaunt form housing magnificent power. These eelfolk stormcallers gain the ability to channel the tempest's might, summoning lightning bolts and gales of wind to pummel their foes.

## First-Year Student

A student who has not yet chosen one of Strixhaven's five mystic colleges is referred to as a first-year student, after the one year of basic curriculum that most students must complete before selecting their school. These beginner students are taught by faculty from all of Strixhaven's colleges, learning rudimentary magic as they acclimate to the university's environment. Once a student has selected a college, they trade their plain gray first-year uniforms for the trappings of their chosen school and begin honing—or even replacing—the magic they learned in their initial year with other skills.

## Hagspawn Barbarian

Hagspawn are the discarded offspring of a hag. Hated by their mother and disowned by the human population, hagspawn are stoic beings left to survive in a world that treats them as anathema.

***Wanderers without a homeland.*** Hagspawn are beings of great loneliness. Some are raised for a short time by their hag mothers, then sent into the world. Others are abandoned at birth; these foundlings are raised by their adoptive parents, yet hags and humans abhor hagspawn, leaving them to move through the world alone.

***Strong and resilient.*** Inheriting great strength and a fiendish nature from their hag parentage, hagspawn are physically powerful. They are doughty and tough, having tough skin and tremendous physical resources.

***Capable of great deeds.*** Even the humans who despite hagspawn agree on the legendary feats of arms these beings are capable of. Broadminded folk listen to these legends and see immense potential in each hagspawn they encounter. Given a chance to prove themselves, hagspawn are more than capable of being trusted and powerful allies.

## Kobold Air Cavalry

Kobolds come in many shapes and sizes, many of which have been detailed in other publications. There are a few kobold groups, however, that seem to have flown under the radar of those who study their culture and habitat. The following is a detailed study of one such group within the kobold society.

**Kobold Air Cavalry**. Kobold's adoration of dragons is as ancient as the origin of Kurtulmak, and kobolds are known to provide service, and worship, to dragon kind. Occasionally a dragon may see fit to reward a tribe of kobolds with a momentous boon–a clutch of kobold/dragon hybrid eggs. Strong and agile winged kobolds with breath weapons are the result.

## Spirit Folk Priest of Bhalla

The spirit folk are a people descended from human and guardian spirit ancestors. They are rare and most often found in the mountains or near riverbeds.

***At home in two worlds.*** Spirit folk have a close affinity to the natural environment. As descendents of the guardian spirits of Rashemen, they feel equally at home in the natural world or in the small towns and cities of this region.

***Serene and wise.*** Those who encounter spirit folk often remark on their effervescent joy for life. Spirit folk are deeply engaged in life and see themselves as rooted and belonging to the world, not at odds with it. This continent awakens both envy and admiration in those whom they encounter.

***Long lived travellers.*** Spirit folk can live up to 400 years. During their long lives, some engage the human world directly, living within communities acting as clerics of local gods or trusted councillors. To avoid becoming too heavily relied upon, most spirit folk only stay in a settlement for the duration of one human generation, then leave to find a new home where they might contribute.

## Werespider

Werespiders are graceful, slender lycanthropes straight from many people's worst nightmares. When they are at rest, werespiders sit perfectly still in dark corners.

**Patient Assassins**. Werespiders are stealthy assassins with cold and distant personalities. They are extremely patient and can wait unmoving for days in a small space to ambush their prey. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, werespiders prefer light and ranged weapons and use surprise to bring down enemies.

**Scourge of the Underdark**. Werespiders are most common in the Underdark. Duergar and svirfneblin who become werespiders will usually leave their cities and wander the tunnels of the Underdark, staying in their hybrid or beast form to keep away predators. Some even head to the surface where finding prey is easier. Drow who become cursed remain in civilization and are open about their lycanthropy, claiming the condition is a blessing from Lolth.

## White Tusk Bloodrager

Bloodragers of the White Tusk clan practice the art of death and express their mastery with precise strokes of their dual falchions. They are the most disciplined orcs in the White Tusk clan, and train daily with Bonebreaker Dorokor to hone their Skills.

Through constant training, orcish bloodragers have developed a state of pure focus. In this cold fury, their sword strokes rend flesh with preternatural ease and their powerful bodies simply refuse to die.

## White Tusk Juggernaut

The White Tusk orc clan named itself after its hulking warriors who, in addition to their massive bodies, possessed enormous white tusks. White Tusk juggernauts pride themselves not just in their battle prowess but also in the size and sharpness of their monstrous lower canines. Some juggernauts have their tusks pierced and display fearsome jewelry from their teeth, others decorate them with ink or paint, and those who can withstand the pain even have symbols or runes inscribed upon them.

A juggernaut's immense muscles allow them to wield oversized weapons worthy of their bloodlust, and they wear thick metal armor forged together in piecemeal from bits of plate armor scavenged from the corpses of their more knightly victims.

## White Tusk Orc

The rank and file of the White Tusk clan pride themselves on being larger and, thanks to Bonebreaker Dorokor's leadership since the investiture of Castle Rend, more devastating in combat than normal orcs.

They are a chaotic evil tribe who care only for strength and the subjugation of their enemies. They delight in cruelty. But Bonebreaker Dorokor is lawful, and has led them to triumph over the humanoids of the forest. So they obey her...for now.

## White Tusk Shaman

Most orc clans keep a shaman or two around to interpret the will of the natural world. These shamans enjoy a high status in their clan, even when a tribe such as the White Tusks possess warspeakers who manifest the will of the gods, for there are more powers in this world than that of the gods. The Mundane World itself possesses a sort of consciousness—the whispering of the wind, the babbling of running water, and the quiet grumbling of the mountains; these small gestures of nature are the world speaking to those who possess the skill to listen.

As part of their training, orcish shamans bond with a single animal, typically a dire wolf. When that animal dies, as all things must, the shaman takes that animal's spirit into their own body to make their bond eternal. A spirit-bonded shaman can take the shape of their bonded animal.

## White Tusk Warspeaker

Priests of Grole, orcish god of war and slaughter, live for the chance to kill in the name of their bloodstained god. Dressed in war-robes of scavenged leather and mail, these priests bestow the blessing of pain upon their allies, goading them to die gloriously in combat in the name of Grole.

Warspeakers seek conflict constantly, flying into a frothing rage at the slightest provocation. When their clan is at peace, they scheme and search for ways to trick or coerce their chieftain into attacking—and if they cannot, they scheme against their chieftain and convince a more aggressive orc into supplanting their "soft, peace-loving" leader.
