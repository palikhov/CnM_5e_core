## Aarakocra

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-an-aaracokra/](AARAKOCRA's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of the highest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds in peace and solitude. Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet.

About halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the length of the wing and locks in place for flying.

Though the wing-hands cannot grasp during flight, they are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on the ground and its wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor in a bony chest plate that provides the aarakocra with extra protection.

The powerful legs end in four sharp talons that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands, also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. The hand bones, like the rest of an aarakocra's skeleton, are hollow and fragile.

Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They have gray-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide keen binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally males are red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray.

Aarakocra speak their own language, the language of giant eagles, and, on occasion, the common tongue (10% chance).

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Aarakocra live in small tribes of about 1d20+10 members. Each tribe has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles with colorful banners and pennants marking the boundaries.

Each tribe lives in a communal nest made of woven vines with a soft lining of dried grass. The eldest male serves as the tribe's leader. In tribes of more than 20 members, the second oldest male serves as the shaman, leading simple religious ceremonies involving the whistling of melodic hymns at sunset on the first day of a new month.

Males spend most of their waking hours hunting for food and occasionally for treasure, such as gems and other shiny objects. Females spend eight months of the year incubating their eggs, passing the time by fabricating javelins and other tools from wood and stone.

While resting on their backs, aarakocra females can use all four hands at the same time to weave boundary pennants, javelins sheaths, and other useful objects from vines and feathers.

Five aarakocra, including a shaman, can summon an air elemental by chanting and performing an intricate aerial dance for three melee rounds. The summoned air elemental will comply with the aarakocras' request for a favor, though it will not endanger its life on their behalf.

Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and will not willingly enter a cave, building, or other enclosed area.

ECOLOGY

Aarakocra have little to do with other species, including neighboring aarakocra tribes, and leave their home territory only in extreme circumstances. They rarely encounter humans except for an occasional foray into a rural community to snatch a stray farm animal; this is not an intentionally malicious act, as aarakocra are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild animals.

A human venturing into aarakocra territory may be able to convince one to serve as a guide or a scout in exchange for a shiny jewel or coin.

## Agni, Indian Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/agni-indian-avatar/](Agni, Indian Avatar)

DESCRIPTION

Agni's avatar is a large red-skinned man with seven faces and three arms. In addition to his red axe, he carries a fan he can use to create winds (as a gust of wind spell).

Agni, in sanskrit means Fire while in latin is Ignis fire-god of Hinduism, second only to Indra in the Vedic mythology of ancient India.

He is equally the fire of the sun, of lightning, and of both the domestic and the sacrificial hearth. As the divine personification of the fire of sacrifice, he is the mouth of the gods, the carrier of the oblation, and the messenger between the human and the divine orders.

Agni is described in the scriptures as ruddy-hued and having two faces one beneficent and one malignant. He has three or seven tongues, hair that stands on end like flames, three legs, and seven arms; he is accompanied by a ram, the usual sacrificial animal.

In the Rigveda he is sometimes identified with Rudra, the forerunner of the god Shiva.

Though Agni has no sect in modern Hinduism, his presence is invoked in many ceremonies, especially by Agnihotri Brahmans (who perform fire rites), and he is the guardian of the southeast.

## Amaterasu, Japanese Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/amaterasu-japanese-avatar/](Amaterasu, Japanese Avatar)

DESCRIPTION

Amaterasu's avatar is a beautiful woman with a radiant smile.

Amaterasu, also known as Amaterasu-Ōmikami among other names, is the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology.

One of the major deities (kami) of Shinto, and the mythical ancestress of the Japanese imperial house via her grandson Ninigi.

Along with her siblings, the moon deity Tsukuyomi and the impetuous storm god Susanoo, she is considered to be one of the "Three Precious Children", the three most important offspring of the creator god Izanagi.

Amaterasu's chief place of worship, the Grand Shrine of Ise, is one of Shinto's holiest sites and a major pilgrimage center and tourist spot.

As with other Shinto kami, she is also enshrined in a number of Shinto shrines throughout Japan.

AMATERASU & THE CAVE

Perhaps the most celebrated myth concerning Amaterasu is when she blocked herself in a cave following an argument with Susanoo when he surprised the goddess with a monstrous flayed horse when she was quietly weaving in her palace with her younger sister Waka-hiru-me. As a consequence of Amaterasu's disappearance, the world was cast in total darkness and evil spirits ran riot over the earth. Read more...

## Amatsu Mikaboshi, Japanese Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/amatsu-mikaboshi-japanese-avatar/ ](Amatsu Mikaboshi, Japanese Avatar)

DESCRIPTION

Amatsu-Mikaboshi's avatar most often appears has a small , charming man with a bald head and a hooked nose, but the god of evil has also been known to shape his avatar in the form of an alluring woman.

Amatsu-Mikaboshi is a nebulous presence, and attempts to explain who or what he is are no less nebulous. At some point, he may have been the only force in the world: Amatsu-Mikaboshi may be the primordial great void. He ruled the universe, if only because nothing else existed.

Somehow during creation of the modern universe, his power was broken but never completely disappeared. Instead, his aura or residue remains. Read more...

## Anhur, Egyptian Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/anhur-egyptians-avatar/](Anhur, Egyptian Avatar)

DESCRIPTION

Anhur's avatar always appears as a four-armed warrior with a mighty lance held in his right arms. He will initiate combat only against those of evil alignment, but will answer any attack upon himself or his followers with great rage.

In early Egyptian mythology, Anhur was a god of war who was worshipped in the Egyptian area of Abydos, and particularly in Thinis. Myths told that he had brought his wife, Mehit, who was his female counterpart, from Nubia, and his name reflects this it means (one who) leads back the distant one.

One of his titles was Slayer of Enemies. Anhur was depicted as a bearded man wearing a robe and a headdress with four feathers, holding a spear or lance, or occasionally as a lion-headed god (representing strength and power). In some depictions, the robe was more similar to a kilt.

## Aphrodite, Greek Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/aphrodite-greek-avatar/](Aphrodite, Greek Avatar)

Aphrodite's avatar is a scantily clad woman of incredible beauty.

Venus by the Romans. The Greek word aphros means "foam," and Hesiod relates in his Theogony that Aphrodite was born from the white foam produced by the severed genitals of Uranus (Heaven), after his son Cronus threw them into the sea.

Aphrodite was, in fact, widely worshipped as a goddess of the sea and of seafaring; she was also honoured as a goddess of war, especially at Sparta, Thebes, Cyprus, and other places.

However, she was known primarily as a goddess of love and fertility and even occasionally presided over marriage.

Although prostitutes considered Aphrodite their patron, her public cult was generally solemn and even austere.

DESCRIPTION

Apollo's avatar is well-muscled, handsome youth.

In Welsh mythology, Arawn was the king of the otherworld realm of Annwn, appearing prominently in the first branch of the Mabinogi, and alluded to in the fourth.

In later tradition, the role of the king of Annwn was largely attributed to the Welsh psychopomp, Gwyn ap Nudd meaning "white" (i.e.'winter') a possible kenning for the god's true name.

However, Arawn's memory is retained in a traditional saying found in an old Cardigan folktale:

- Hir yw'r dydd a hir yw'r nos, a hir yw aros Arawn

- "Long is the day and long is the night, and long is the waiting of Arawn"

## Ares, Greek Avatar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-a/ares-greek-avatar/](Ares, Greek Avatar)

DESCRIPTION

Ares' avatar appears to be a huge fighter with bloodthirsty red eyes. He is powerfully built and carries a deadly looking spear.

Ares, in Greek religion, god of war or, more properly, the spirit of battle. Unlike his Roman counterpart, Mars, he was never very popular, and his worship was not extensive in Greece.

He represented the distasteful aspects of brutal warfare and slaughter. From at least the time of Homer who established him as the son of the chief god, Zeus, and Hera, his consort Ares was one of the Olympian deities; his fellow gods and even his parents, however, were not fond of him.

Nonetheless, he was accompanied in battle, by his sister Eris and his sons (by Aphrodite) Phobos and Deimos. Also associated with him were two lesser war deities: Enyalius, who is virtually identical with Ares himself, and Enyo, a female counterpart.

## Baldur, Norse Avatar

DESCRIPTION

Baldur's avatar takes the form of an incredibly handsome fighter. More often than not, he is followed by an entourage of several hundred women.

When Baldur began to have dreams of his death, Frigga went around to everything in the world and secured from each of them an oath to not harm her son. Confident in Baldur's invincibility, the gods amused themselves by throwing weapons and any random thing they could find at Baldur and watching them bounce off of him, leaving him utterly unscathed.

## Bugbear

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-b/bugbears-5e-stats/](Bugbear)

BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)

DESCRIPTION

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Leader

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.

Chief

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.

The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.

Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.

Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.

Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.

ECOLOGY

Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot.

BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)

DESCRIPTION

Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.

Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.

Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.

The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.

The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.

Leader

If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.

Chief

If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.

In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.

## Bullywug

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-b/bullywug-5e-stats/](Bullywug)

DESCRIPTION

The bullywugs are a race of bipedal, frog-like amphibians. They inhabit swamps, marshes, meres, or other dank places.

Bullywugs are covered with smooth, mottled olive green hide that is reasonably tough. They can vary in size from smaller than the average human to about seven feet in height. Their faces resemble those of enormous frogs, with wide mouths and large, bulbous eyes; their feet and hands are webbed. Though they wear no clothing, all bullywugs use weapons, armor, and shields if they are available. Bullywugs have their own language and the more intelligent ones can speak a limited form of the common tongue.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

More intelligent than frogs, all bullywugs live in organized or semi-organized socially fascist groups, cooperating for the purpose of hunting and survival. They live primarily on fish and any other game, preferring a diet of meat. They are adept hunters and fisherman, and skilled in the use and construction of snares and nets.

Bullywug society is a savage one. Males are the dominant sex, and females exist only to lay eggs. Though females and young make up about one-half of any tribe, they count for little in the social order. The only signs of respect that bullywugs ever bestow are toward their leader and their bizarre frog god. The race totally lacks any higher emotions or feelings.

The leader of a bullywug community is a large individual with 18 hit points. Communities of 30 or more bullywugs have five subleaders (16 hp each) and a powerful leader (3 HD, 27 hp, strenght 14). Communities of 60 or more bullywugs have a chieftain (4 HD, 36 hp, strenght 14) and five subchieftains (3 HD, 27 hp, strenght 14).

All bullywugs favor dank, dark places to live, since they must keep their skin moist. Most bullywugs live in the open and maintain only loose territorial boundaries. Ordinary bullywugs do not deal with incursions into their territory very efficiently, but they kill and eat interlopers if they can. They hate their large relatives advanced bullywugs with a passion, and make war upon them at every opportunity. Bullywugs prize treasure, though it benefits them little. They value coins and jewels, and occasionally a magical item can be found amongst their hoard.

On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite. The tribes are lead by the dominant male, who kills and eats the previous leader when it is too old to rule. This is one of the few instances when they fight among themselves.

ECOLOGY

Bullywugs tend to disrupt ecosystems, rather than fill a niche in them. They do not have the intelligence to harvest their food supplies sensibly and will fish and hunt in an area until its natural resources are depleted, and then move on to a new territory. They hate men, and will attack them on sight, but fortunately prefer to dwell in isolated regions far from human beings.

Bullywug is employed as material component to empower the following spells: *Jump*

## Deep Gnome (Svirfneblin)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/deep-gnome-or-svirfnebli-5e-stats/](Deep Gnome (Svirfneblin))

DESCRIPTION

Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow, and mind flayers.

Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin, wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.

Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate with each other by some form of racial empathy. These small folk can also converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via a curious "language" consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch conveys a different message), although only on a very basic level.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between the sexes: females are in charge of food production and running the city, while males patrol its borders and mine for precious stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of responsibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for new lodes.

For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be a 4th level overseer.

Groups of more than 20 will be led by a 6th level burrow warden with two 5th-level assistants.

ECOLOGY

Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Underdark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that creatures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape.

## Derro

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-d/derro-5e-stats/](Derro)

DESCRIPTION

Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have dwelled in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves by their marked cruelty. It is said that a derro lives for two things: the slow and humiliating death of surface demihumans and especially humans, and the perversion of knowledge for their own dark ends.

Derro are short, with skin the color of an ice-covered lake (white, with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always straight), and staring, pupil-less eyes. Their features remind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle. Derro prefer weapons designed to cripple opponents, rather than those built for a quick kill: derro don't see any sport in spears and axes.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Derro dwell in large underground complexes, nearer the surface than the kuo-toa and drow, but deeper than goblins and trolls. They never expose themselves to direct sunlight, as it nauseates them. Sunlight would kill a derro were he to be exposed to it for a few days. Yet derro occasionally visit the surface world at night, raiding for humans or carrying out a savant's plans.

Derro are never encountered singly. From their combat tactics to their choice of spells, derro demonstrate a mob mentality. A lone demo (the last survivor of an ill-fated patrol, perhaps) is a desperate derro, seeking at all costs to return to his home lair.

A derro lair always has 3d4 + 30 normal derro, plus leaders. The members of the lair are led by the resident savants (1d3 in number) and their apprentices (1d4+1 student savants). Derro unquestioningly obey the puzzling, even suicidal, dictates from their savant leaders.

Should a lair grow very much over 40 inhabitants, half the group (with half the savants and half the leaders) will split off and form an independent community. Such a splinter group will travel quite a distance before settling down, as no two derro lairs have been spotted within several miles of each other. The two groups may communicate for a short time, in order to ensure the new lair's safety, but they soon sever all contacts and act utterly independently of one another. Although it is possible for two lairs to be at war with one another, or to join in combat against a common enemy, no examples of these behaviors have ever been recorded, with the exception of the regular Uniting War, described below.

Also to be found in a derro lair are 5d6+10 human slaves. If any of the lair's savants or students know the *charm person* spell, each slave has a 90% chance of being charmed. Derro hate humans more than any other race; they use humans for the most demeaning manual labor and for breeding.

The derro are said to have a major stronghold somewhere in the Underdark, and there the savants plot and scheme to devastate the surface world and enslave all humanity.

Derro do not appear to worship any powers, but the savants treasure knowledge and the rest of the race pretty much worships the savants. The worst criminals in the derro community, subject to the Polite Execution (which takes a good two weeks, and which roams over miles of subterranean territory), are those who do not follow the laws of the savants.

Most of those laws have to do with the derros' goals: the destruction of humanity and the acquisition of arcane and obscure information. Derro usually scour their territory for magical items, stealing them or, if necessary, purchasing them from more powerful creatures. Derro do not share the love of gold common to their dwarfish relatives, and they have been known to pay exorbitant prices for a few potions or for a magical item with a missing command word.

This serves as one of the bases of trade between derro and other races of the Underdark. Drow find derro to be dangerous opponents (due to the latter's magic resistance) and a race of barbarians with too much interest in the surface world. The mind flayers think the derro taste bad. Duergar disapprove of the derro's love of cruelty. And derro really don't much care about the other races deep beneath the surface. But derro often raid the surface and acquire technology or items that other deep races desire, and so limited trade between a lair and some surrounding creatures is possible.

Every 20 years or so, the derro race mounts an all-out war against other creatures of the Underdark. This is known as the Uniting War, and no savant really expects to win it. The War is a means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal point for racial identity, and a chance to really start some terror throughout the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. That is, humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the Underdark, and will send hundreds of scouting and adventuring parties into the deep underground to investigate. The derro welcome this new source of slaves.

ECOLOGY

Derro can live on a diet of underground fungi, but they find the stuff to be foul-tasting if used as anything other than spices. Thus they seek out other sustenance whenever possible. A derro hunting party usually pursues large, dangerous prey that can feed the entire lair, rather than smaller, simpler food. The derro tendency to torment prey holds true with hunting for food.

The derro also raid other races for food. Sometimes, they merely rob the dwarves or the orcs, hoping to provoke an amusing conflict. But such excursions are tame compared to Open Hunting, the derro term for midnight raids into human settlements. When Open Hunting, a derro party steals cattle and swine, to let loose and hunt at a later time, but it primarily kidnaps humans. As mentioned before, derro treasure humans for slaves and for breeding.

Derro have few other roles in the underground ecosystem. In the last few Uniting Wars, the drow noticed that derro blood (a milky substance that turns brown and rotten upon the slightest exposure to bright light) was a useful ingredient in drow potions.

## Duergar

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-d/duergar-or-gray-dwarf-5e-stats/](Duergar (or gray dwarf))

DESCRIPTION

The duergar, or gray dwarves, are a malevolent breed that dwells in the extreme depths of the ground. Thief duergar are proficient in the use of poison.

Duergar appear to be emaciated, nasty-looking dwarves. Their complexion and hair range from medium to dark gray. They prefer drab clothing designed to blend into their environment. In their lair, they may wear jewelry, although such pieces are kept dull.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

The duergar are similar to other dwarves cultures, although the life is much harsher due to their hostile environment deep under the ground. They do not venture into the surface except at night or on the gloomiest days. Duergar live longer than their surface-dwelling kin. Life spans can reach 400 years or more.

Duergar lairs are always deep underground. These are elaborate collection of chambers, passages, rooms, and secret areas. There is a chance a monster is kept as a guardian for the lair complex. Such a creature is probably kept at an entrance to the duergar complex or kept within the treasure cave.

Duergar raise giant spiders called steeders for mounts. A large chamber serves as "corral" for the herd of 20d10 steeders of various sizes.

The duergar are not as affluent as other dwarven races. Individuals may have a few gold or platinum coins stashed away. Normal, usable items like weapons or armor are immediately distributed. Magical items and the bulk of the acquired treasure is stored in a well-protected chamber deep in the duergar complex.

The duergar diet is an omnivorous mix of fungi, insects, and subterranean animals. Duergar complexes include caverns used as fungus farms that are filled with giant, edible mushrooms. They brew a potent ale from such mushrooms.

ECOLOGY

Duergar detest the other dwarves races, whom they consider pampered. weak, and self-indulgent. They may ally and even share living space with evil dwarves, but the duergar's hostile nature snakes such alliances extremely rare.

Duergar tend to see intruders as invaders. Even if trespassers can convince the duergar of their peaceful intentions, the duergar may demand a stiff toll to permit safe passage. Even then, duergar may discreetly follow the travelers to see what they are up to and, if treasure is involved, to steal such riches for themselves.

Duergar rarely bother surface-dwellers due to their disadvantages on the surface. When encountered on the surface, such dwarves are usually on a mission or part of a raiding party.

## Giff

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/giff-5e-stats/](Giff)

DESCRIPTION

The giff are a race of powerfully muscled mercenaries. They are civilized, though they lack mages among their own race. Giff hire on with various groups throughout the universe as mercenaries, bodyguards, enforcers, and general legbreakers.

The giff is humanoid, with stocky, flat, cylindrical legs and a humanoid torso, arms, and fingers. Its chest is broad and supports a hippopotamus head with a natural helmet of flexible, chitinous plates. Giff come in colors ranging from black to gray to a rich gold, and many have colorful tattoos that leave their bodies a patchwork record of past victories. Giff speak their own language and the Common tongue.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

The giff are happiest among their own race they consider larger races such as giants threatening and complain about the fragility of the smaller races. Unlike the dracons, they suffer no penalties for being apart from their fellows, but merely prefer the company of their own species. Outside their own platoons, the giff are happiest among military organizations with a strong chain of command.

Every giff, male, female, and giffling, has a rank within society, which can only be changed by someone of higher rank. Within this rank are subranks and within those subranks are color markings and badges. The highest-ranking giff gives the orders, the others obey. It does not matter if the orders are foolish or even suicidal following them is the purpose of the giff in the universe. A quasi-mystical faith among the giff mercenaries confirm that all things have their place, and the giff's is to follow orders. This makes the giff very happy.

Giff platoons can be hired by those looking for their muscle. The arcane do a small business in giff mercenaries, but usually local contractors perform the task. These contractors review prospective employers according to ability to pay, then make a recommendation to the giff leaders. The leaders, in turn, consider the danger of the job, and whether taking it will enhance their giffdom.

Giff jobs are usually paid in smoke powder, though they often will accept other weapons and armor. It is purely a barter system, but to hire one giff for one standard week requires seven charges of smoke powder (one/day). In areas where smoke powder is more common, the price will rise.

On board ship, the giff have their own quarters, and will often request to bring on their own large weapons. They favor greek fire projectors and bombards for ground work, and will happily blaze away at opponents, regardless of the tactical situation.

The giff require the ships of others because they have no spellcasting abilities among them they are magically inert in such a way that even the serial helms of the mind flayers have no effect on them. Lifejammers are considered to be a "wizard's way to die" (a giff insult). Giff trade their services for transport and for weapons especially smoke powder.

Giff of both sexes serve in their platoons, and both fight equally well. Gill young are raised tenderly until they are old enough to survive an exploding arquebus, then are inducted fully into the platoon.

Giff are fierce fighters, despite their somewhat comical appearance and mania for weapons. They will not, however, willingly fight other giff. If forced into such a situation on a battlefield, both groups will retire for at least a day of drinking and sorting out ranks. There is a 10% chance that one platoon will join another in this case, but most likely both will quit their current hirings and look for work elsewhere.

ECOLOGY

Like the dracon, the giff are surmises to have evolved from one world, which was not blessed with a wide variety of intelligent species such as elves, men, dwarves, and beholders. Sages point to the giff as an example of what happens when only one sentient species is found on a planet.

The giff homeworld is the stuff of legend; as no living giff has seen it. Some tales say that the homeworld was destroyed by the giff, who were rescued by the arcane. Others say that the giff sold their planet and their lives to the arcane in exchange for spelljamming helms they could not use. Still others say that the giff homeworld is just beyond the range of one's ship, in a land where such warrior races are common, and the losers are exiled to the known worlds.

Whatever the truth, the giff describe their homeworld in legendary terms a thick, verdant jungle, covered with swamps, mangrove trees, and fruit plants. The few mountains are rich in metals, caches of weapons. and smoke powder.

The giff practice equality among the sexes in battle and in childrearing. They live about 70 years, but do not take aging gracefully. As a giff grows older and begins to slow down, he is possessed with the idea of proving himself still young and vital, usually in battle. As a result, there are very, very few old giff.

## Githyanki Gish

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/githyanki-gish-5e-stats/](Githyanki Gish)

DESCRIPTION

Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the githzerai.

Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).

These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.

Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.

A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.

All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.

Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.

A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will contain the following:

One supreme leader 11th-level fighter or 7th mage

Two captains 8th-level fighter and 7th mage

One knight 8th level

Two warlocks mages of 7th level

Three sergeants fighters of 7th level

Two 'gish' fighter/mages of 4th/4th level

20-50 lower levels determined randomly using the table above, of 1st-3rd level

On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts and companions to the githyanki. When encountered on the Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group will typically consist of the following:

One captain 8th-level fighter

One warlock 7th-level mage

Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level

Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for these services is unknown.

An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.

ECOLOGY

Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.

G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.

Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.

Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.

More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.

Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai is the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement.

ECOLOGY

Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.

G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.

Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.

Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.

More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.

Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai is the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement.

## Githyanki Knight

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/githyanki-knight-5e-stats/](Githyanki Knight)

DESCRIPTION

Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the githzerai.

Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).

These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.

Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.

A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.

All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.

Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.

A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will contain the following:

One supreme leader 11th-level fighter or 7th mage

Two captains 8th-level fighter and 7th mage

One knight 8th level

Two warlocks mages of 7th level

Three sergeants fighters of 7th level

Two 'gish' fighter/mages of 4th/4th level

20-50 lower levels determined randomly using the table above, of 1st-3rd level

On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts and companions to the githyanki. When encountered on the Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group will typically consist of the following:

One captain 8th-level fighter

One warlock 7th-level mage

Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level

Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for these services is unknown.

An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.

ECOLOGY

Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.

G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.

Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.

Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.

More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.

Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement.

## Githzerai Monk

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/githzerai-monk-5e-stats/](Githzerai Monk)

DESCRIPTION

Githzerai are very similar in appearance to their githyanki cousins, although they tend to look much more human. Their features are for the most part unremarkable, with vaguely noble countenance. Their skin tone is that of human caucasian flesh. Githzerai dress simply, wearing functional clothing and favoring conservative tones.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

The githzerai were originally offspring of a race of humans that were freed from slavery under mind flayers by a great female warrior named Gith. These men and women did not, however, choose to follow Gith's ways after they revolted against their slavers. Instead, they fell sway to the teachings of a powerful wizard who proclaimed himself king and later, god of the people. The githzerai then separated themselves from the githyanki, beginning a great racial war that has endured the long millennia without diminishing.

The githzerai, who worship a powerful and ancient wizard as though he were a god (he is not), are destroyed before they have enough power to become a threat to their ruler.

If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in the following numbers:

One supreme leader 9th-level fighter or 7th-level mage

One captain 6th-level fighter or 4th-level mage

Two warlocks mages of 5th level

Three sergeants fighters of 5th level

Three 'zerths' fighter/mages of 3rd/3rd level

1d4+1 x 10 lesser githzerai evenly distributed between the three possible classes and of 1st to 3rd level

A thief, if present (10% chance), will replace one of the lower level githzerai and will be of 10th level.

The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Limbo. They have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position there is very strong. Typically, one of these fortresses contains approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. This leader has absolute control over the githzerai, including the powers of life and death.

The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of adamantite rising as huge squat towers from dusty plains. Each houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leader.

On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Living in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the githzerai enjoy total power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredictable plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'kt'lor. This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters. The greatest generals and nobles of the race meet here to plan githzerai strategy for battling both the githyanki and the mind flayers. There is likely no force on Limbo that could readily threaten the power of Shra'kt'lor or its many inhabitants.

One of the prime motivations among the githzerai is their war with the githyanki. These offshoots of Gith's original race are obsessed with this war of extermination. They often employ mercenaries on the Prime Material plane to aid them in battling the githyanki. The evil, destructive nature of the githyanki makes the hiring of mercenaries to fight them a relatively simple task.

Legend of the Zerthimon: In githzerai lore there is a central figure that is revered above all others Zerthimon. The githyanki believe him to be a great god that was once a man. According to githzerai lore, when the original race broke free of the mind flayers, it was Zerthimon that opposed Gith, claiming that she was hateful and unfit to lead the people.

There ensued a great battle and the people were polarized by the two powers. Those that chose to support Gith became the githyanki. Those that supported Zerthimon became the githzerai.

Zerthimon died in the battle, but in his sacrifice he freed the githzerai from Gith. The githzerai believe that someday Zerthimon, in his new godly form, will return and take the them to a place on another plane.

Zerths are special among the githzerai, acting as focal points for the attention of Zerthimon. The githzerai believe that when Zerthimon returns for them, he will first gather all of the zerths and lead them to their new paradise. It might be said that the zerths are the center of githzerai religion. Unfortunately, they are not free from religious persecution.

The wizard-king (whose name is not known) that rules over the highly superstitious githzerai would like very much to stamp out the legend of Zerthimon. The wizard-king believes that this legend challenges his authority, and very likely it does. However, he has never been able to rid the githzerai of this legend and he is now forced to tolerate it.

Rrakkma bands: Although the githzerai are not a bitter or overly violent race, they still tend to hold a strong enmity and hatred for the race of illithids that originally enslaved the gith race so many thousands of years ago. By human terms, that may be a very long time to hold a grudge, but the githzerai see the mind flayers as the cause of the split of the Gith race and much of the hardships the githzerai are forced to endure. Thus large rrakkma (in the githzerai tongue) bands are often formed to hunt mind flayers. These bands typically consist of 1d4+2 x 10 githzerai warriors led by the githzerai equivalent of a sergeant. For roughly three months, these bands will roam the outer and inner planes, searching for groups of illithids and destroying them utterly. The rrakkma bands are very popular in githzerai society and it is considered to be an honor to serve in one.

The githzerai fortresses on the Prime Material plane tend to be very large affairs with great, impenetrable walls. Wherever these fortresses stand, they destroy the landscape for miles. No plants or animals live within many miles of the fortresses and the land is reduced to wasteland around them. It is not known if the effect is just the land's reaction to the "other-planar" stuff of which the castles are constructed, or if githzerai mages magically produce the effect in order to keep material beings away from these fortresses.

The most likely purpose of these fortresses on the Prime Material plane is to keep tabs on the githyanki. The githzerai, not being a particularly war-mongering or violent race, have no desire to conquer the Prime Material plane like the githyanki do. However, the githzerai realize that if their enemies have a strong hold on the Prime Material plane, they will become more powerful and thus will hold power over them. The githzerai carefully monitor the progress on the githyanki and lead coordinated, focused strikes against strongpoints of the githyanki, thus hampering their ability to expand and grow in the Prime Material plane.

During these attacks, the githzerai will not intentionally attack the natural denizens of the Prime Material plane (humans, demihumans, humanoids, etc.), but they will never sacrifice a well-planned attack on the githyanki just to preserve life. With the githzerai, the ends will always justify the means.

Like the githyanki, the githzerai really have no part in the Blood War of the fiends. They seldom venture to the lower planes, and only then for matters of absolute importance. The githzerai find the bloodthirsty, destructive nature of the fiends to be distasteful, so they will typically not deal with those creatures for any reason. They coexist with the slaadi, and githzerai are rumored to have mental powers beyond those described here.

ECOLOGY

For as long as men have known of the ability to travel the planes, they have wondered at the natural power of the githzerai to wander from plane to plane at will. Although man and githzerai are not natural enemies, battles are frequently fought between the two races, due in part to some humans' desire to capture a live githzerai for study. To date, no such creature has been secured.

DESCRIPTION

Although a formidable fighter, a gloom weaver is often content to remain hidden in the shadows, watching with rapt attention as its very presence affects its victims. Its dark energy weighs down the heart, causing those within its oppressive aura to feel the approach of death.

## Gnoll

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/gnoll/](Gnoll)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-gnoll/](GNOLL's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands. While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human.

They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane. Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the tongues of flinds, trolls, orcs, or hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Gnolls are most often encountered underground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they operate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will have (30% chance) 1d3 trolls as guards and servants.

Above ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4d4 hyenas (80%) or 2d6 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards. A gnoll lair will contain between 20d10 adult males. For every 20 gnoll, there will be a 7 Hit Die leader. If 100 or more are encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 10 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of 17, and who receives a +5 to hit and +3 on damage rolls due to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 2d6 elite warrior guards of 7 Hit Dice (AC 16).

In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and may have many more.

Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a relative equality of strength. Otherwise the polls will kill and eat their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.

ECOLOGY

Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelligent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take several years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age,

the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old.

## Gnoll Fang of Yenooghu

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-gnoll/](GNOLL's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands. While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human.

They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane. Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the tongues of flinds, trolls, orcs, or hobgoblins.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Gnolls are most often encountered underground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they operate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will have (30% chance) 1d3 trolls as guards and servants.

Above ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4d4 hyenas (80%) or 2d6 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards. A gnoll lair will contain between 20d10 adult males. For every 20 gnoll, there will be a 7 Hit Die leader. If 100 or more are encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 10 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of 17, and who receives a +5 to hit and +3 on damage rolls due to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 2d6 elite warrior guards of 7 Hit Dice (AC 16).

In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and may have many more.

Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a relative equality of strength. Otherwise the polls will kill and eat their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.

ECOLOGY

Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelligent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take several years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age,

the typical gnoll lives to be about 35 years old.

## Gnoll Flesh Gnawer

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/gnoll-flesh-gnawler-5e-stats/](Gnoll Flesh Gnawer)

DESCRIPTION

If any group of gnolls could be said to be more feral than the others, that distinction would go to the flesh gnawers. These gnolls eschew the use of ranged weapons in favor of short blades that they wield with speed and efficiency. In the thick of a fight, they are capable of dashing across the field, slashing and snarling as they run down stragglers and finish off wounded foes.

## Gnoll Hunter

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/gnoll-hunter-5e-stats/](Gnoll Hunter)

DESCRIPTION

Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a number of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to run roughshod over the enemy's territory. Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow,

and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that produces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.

## Goblin

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/goblin/](Goblin)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-goblin/](GOBLIN's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

These small, evil humanoids would be merely pests, if not for their great numbers. Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths and small, sharp fangs. Their foreheads slope back, and their eyes are usually dull and glazed.

They always walk upright, but their arms hang down almost to their knees. Their skin colors range from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red. Usually a single tribe has members all of about the same color skin.

Their eyes vary from bright red to a gleaming lemon yellow. They wear clothing of dark leather, tending toward dull soiled-looking colors. Goblin speech is harsh, and pitched higher than that of humans.

In addition to their own language, some goblins can speak in the kobold, orc, and hobgoblin tongues.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Humans would consider the caves and underground dwellings of goblins to be dank and dismal. Those few tribes that live above ground are found in ruins, and are only

active at night or on very dark, cloudy days. They use no form of sanitation, and their lairs have a foul stench. Goblins seem to be somewhat resistant to the diseases that breed in such filth.

They live a communal life, sharing large common areas for eating and sleeping. Only leaders have separate living spaces. All their possessions are carried with them. Property of the tribe is kept with the chief and sub-chiefs. Most of their goods are stolen, although they do manufacture their own garments and leather goods.

The concept of privacy is largely foreign to goblins. A typical goblin tribe has 4d10 x 10 adult male warriors. For every 40 goblins there will be a leader and his 4 assistants, each having 3 Hit Die.

For every 200 goblins there will be a sub-chief and 2d4 bodyguards, each of which has 4 Hit Dice, is Armor Class 16, and armed with a battle axe. The tribe has a single goblin chief and 2d4 bodyguards each of 5 Hit Dice, Armor Class 17, and armed with two weapons.

There is a 25% chance that 10% of their force will be mounted upon huge worgs, and have another 1d4x10 unmounted worgs with them. There is a 60% chance that the lair is guarded by 5d6 such wolves, and a 20% chance of 2d6 bugbears. Goblin shamans (clerics) are rare, but have been known to reach 7th level.

In addition to the males, there will be adult females equal to 60% of their number and children equal to the total number of adults in the lair. Neither will fight in battles.

A goblin tribe has an exact pecking order; each member knows who is above him and who is below him. They fight amongst themselves constantly to move up this social ladder.

They often take slaves for both food and labor. The tribe will have slaves of several races numbering 10-40% of the size of the tribe. Slaves are always kept shackled, and are staked to a common chain when sleeping.

Goblins hate most other humanoids, gnomes and dwarves in particular, and work to exterminate them whenever possible.

ECOLOGY

Goblins live only 50 years or so. They do not need to eat much, but will kill just for the pleasure of it. They eat any creature from rats and snakes to humans. In lean times they will eat carrion.

Goblins usually spoil their habitat, driving game from it and depleting the area of all resources. They are decent miners, able to note new or unusual construction in an underground area, and any habitat will soon be expanded by a maze-like network of tunnels.

## Grimlock

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/grimlock-stats/](Grimlock)

DESCRIPTION

Powerfully-built humanoids clad only in dark, filthy rags, these warlike subterranean creatures emerge from their deep caverns at night to search for unlucky humans to add to their larders.

Grimlocks have thick, scaly, grey skin and long, black, filthy hair. Their teeth are white and extremely sharp. Their eyes are blank white orbs.

Grimlocks are totally blind, but have highly developed senses of smell and hearing. Their sensitive ears and noses combine to allow them to distinguish objects and creatures within 30′, just as well as if they were able to see.

COMBAT

Grimlocks are immune to the effects of spells which affect the vision, like phantasmal force, darkness, invisibility, mirror image, and many others.

However, spells such as audible glamer, or any loud, continuous noise will partially "blind" them. This reduces their ability to perceive opponents to a 10 feet range and impose them disadvantage on their attack rolls. Substances such as snuff or strong perfumes will have much the same effect if inhaled by a grimlock or thrown in its face.

Grimlocks attack fiercely, but with little or no organization, often stopping in the middle of battle to carry off fallen foes or comrades for food.

Grimlocks will nearly always attack in darkness if possible. While not adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough to realize that in total darkness, their unique form of perception gives them a distinct advantage.

Since their acute hearing allows them to communicate in voices too faint for other races to hear, grimlocks impose disadvantage on perception checks to be spotted before an attack.

The average size of a grimlock tribe counts 20-200 (20d10) individuals.

For every 10 grimlocks encountered there will be a Grimlock Leader.

For every 40 grimlocks encountered there will be a Champion.

These exceptional individuals will usually be the only ones to show even the most elemental strategy, usually by allowing their followers to weaken opponents before entering battle themselves.

In addition, at DM's discretion, for every leader or champion with the group all grimlocks get a +1 bonus on Wisdom saving throws.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Grimlocks lair in vast cavern complexes in mountainous areas. They are well adapted to these environs. In any rocky terrain they blend in so well that, while motionless, they are completely undetectable unless one actually bumps into them.

In any grimlock lair, there will be nearly as many females (1 Hit Die and AC 6) as males, and at least as many young (1 hit point, AC 6 and non-combatant). Grimlock leaders and champions do wield some control over these communities. However, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader who gave the order is around to enforce his will.

It is nearly impossible for those of other races to tell one grimlock from another although leader types may appear slightly larger but they easily tell each other apart by subtle differences in scent and movement.

Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other races. However, there is a small (10%) chance that they will allow medusae to share their lairs, and a 2% chance that any wandering group will be accompanied by 1-2 mind flayers.

ECOLOGY

Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid creatures, vastly preferring that of humans to all others. Foraging parties often raid the homes of other subterranean races, especially those who keep large slave populations (such as drow). They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids have a large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they have devoured the brains. Grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki for this reason. Since the slave flesh the grimlocks often consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole communities are often decimated by disease.

Grimlock is employed as material component to empower the following spells: *Prestidigitation*

## Grung

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/grung-5e-stats/](Grung)

DESCRIPTION

Grung are highly territorial, toad-like humanoids that dwell in swamps and marshes.

Standing about three feet tall, grung have lower bodies that strongly resemble those of giant frogs or toads, with powerful legs and large webbed feet. Their upper bodies, however, are more developed, with muscular forelimbs, opposable thumbs, and smaller, more humanoid looking heads. They stand upright and move in rapid, short hops. They are incapable of the prodigious leaps and jumps of frogs, toads, or bullywugs.

While evolution has given them intelligence and forelimbs capable of using tools, it has taken away the prehensile tongues of frogs. In its place, the grung's wide mouths are full of the sharp teeth needed by carnivores Grung have the slick, wet skin of other amphibians. Since they breathe through their skin, they must keep it moist. Their coloration is like that of bullfrogs dappled green and brown on their backs, shading to white or yellow on their bellies. Their eyes smaller than those of frogs and toads and protected by bony ridges are red with black pupils. Males are slightly smaller than females.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Grung are war-like, territorial creatures. They typically claim all territory within at least a mile of their tribal settlements. Anyone unwise enough to enter this territory is a target for immediate attack. Grung from other tribes are also fair game; nasty little border wars between neighboring tribes are the rule, not the exception. Most encounters with grung are with wandering war bands looking for trespassers. Grung are always hostile and cannot be negotiated with.

Grung settlements are untidy collections of crude shelters, sometimes concealed inside large dead trees. tribes number 10d6+40 individuals, with young comprising 25% of that number (AC 10, Sw 12, HD ½, #AT 1, Dmg 1 [no poison], SA nil). Grung lay eggs, and their offspring go through a tadpole stage. For this reason, grung settlements are always next to open water. Within three months of hatching, the tadpoles absorb their tails, develop limbs, and climb out of the water and join the tribe as immature grung. These young grungs have 1-1 Hit Dice but otherwise have the same abilities as adults. They reach full maturity in another six months.

Grung tribes are matriarchal. War chiefs are all female, and the tribal chieftain is the strongest fighter among the war chiefs. Rising through the ranks is by duels to the death, with the victor getting the title. Each tribe also has a single female shaman of up to 3rd level. Her spheres are All, Animal, Combat, Healing (reversed spells only), and Plant.

ECOLOGY

Grung eat swamp-dwelling mammals, such as rats, unwary travelers, even other grung. They have few natural predators due to the toxicity of their flesh. Giant poisonous snakes are usually immune to grung poison and actively hunt grung.

The water around grung settlements is tainted by their poisonous secretions. Any non-grung drinking the water must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +3 bonus) or become nauseated for 2d4 rounds. Nauseated creatures fight with penalties of -1 to their attack rolls and +1 to their Armor Class.

Grung poison is almost impossible to bottle (as any exposure to air causes it to decompose in ten rounds).

## Half-Dragon

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-h/half-dragon-5e-stats/](Half-Dragon)

GENERAL NOTES

Some basic restrictions should be laid down regarding half-dragons. There are important exceptions to these rules, but for the most part they should be taken as basic fantasy "truths".

**First**, only male dragons and female humans or demihumans can create half-dragon children; female dragons cannot be impregnated by male humans or demihumans, and beings other than humans or demihumans cannot bear a dragons children. Demihumans include elves, half-elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, kender, and similar humanlike races (including drow).

**Second**, only those dragons with the innate power to shapechange themselves into human or demihuman shape can interbreed with the latter while in the latters form.

**Third**, interbreeding is not possible while a dragon is using a normal polymorph self spell.

**Fourth**, some dragons that might have the power to create half-dragon offspring simply have no interest in doing so, and actively avoid it. These are most commonly dragons who have little or no interest in humanity or have strong prejudices against humans, demihumans, or mammals in general, greatly preferring the company of other dragons alone.

Half-Dragon is employed as material component to empower the following spells:

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-hobgoblin/](HOBGOBLIN's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage a perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing 6 feet tall.

Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red.

Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes. Roughly 20% of them can speak the common tongue of man.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse or open fighting. Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.

Hobgoblins usually organize in tribes. However, during wartime or important military campaigns, the tribes unite to form a legion.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have 2d100 adult male warriors.

- For every 20 male hobgoblins there will be 1 hobgoblin sergeant + 2 hobgoblin assistants with 20 hit points each.

- Groups numbering over 100 are led by a **hobgoblin sub-chief**.

- If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a **hobgoblin chief**. The chief has 5d4 hobgoblin sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.

If the hobgoblins are encountered in a legion, there will be 10d100 of them, led by a **hobgoblin captain** or a **hobgoblin warlord** if the legion numbers more than 5,000 soldiers.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, at least two gates, and 1d4+2 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and 1 ballista for each 50 warriors.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

Hobgoblins are nightmarish mockeries of the humanoid races who have a military society organized in tribal bands. Each tribe is intensely jealous of its status. Chance meetings with other tribes will result in verbal abuse or open fighting. Hobgoblin tribes are found in almost any climate or subterranean realm.

Hobgoblins usually organize in tribes. However, during wartime or important military campaigns, the tribes unite to form a legion.

A typical tribe of hobgoblins will have 2d100 adult male warriors.

- For every 20 male hobgoblins there will be 1 hobgoblin sergeant + 2 hobgoblin assistants with 20 hit points each.

- Groups numbering over 100 are led by a **hobgoblin sub-chief**.

- If the hobgoblins are encountered in their lair, they will be led by a **hobgoblin chief**. The chief has 5d4 hobgoblin sub-chiefs acting as bodyguards.

If the hobgoblins are encountered in a legion, there will be 10d100 of them, led by a **hobgoblin captain** or a **hobgoblin warlord** if the legion numbers more than 5,000 soldiers.

Each tribe has a distinctive battle standard which is carried into combat to inspire the troops. If the tribal chief is leading the battle, he will carry the standard with him, otherwise it will be held by one of his sub-chiefs.

In addition to the warriors present in a hobgoblin tribe, there will be half again that many females and three times as many children as adult males.

Fully 80% of all known hobgoblin lairs are subterranean complexes. The remaining 20% are surface villages which are fortified with a ditch, fence, at least two gates, and 1d4+2 guard towers. Villages are often built upon ruined humanoid settlements and may incorporate defensive features already present in the ruins.

Hobgoblin villages possess artillery in the form of 2 heavy catapults, 2 light catapults, and 1 ballista for each 50 warriors.

ECOLOGY

Hobgoblins feel superior to goblins or orcs and may act as leaders for them. In such cases, the "lesser races" are used as battle fodder. Hobgoblin mercenaries may work for powerful or rich evil humanoids.

## Jackalwere

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-j/jackalwere-5e-stats/](Jackalwere)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/dnd-5e-jackalwere-tactics-build-challenging-encounters-against-a-jackalwere/](JACKALWERE's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

The jackalwere is a terrible and savage creature which preys on unsuspecting travelers and other demihumans that it can ambush. Its ability to alter its shape at will makes it a most dangerous foe.

The jackalwere can be found in any of three forms, showing no preference for any one over the others. The first of these is that of a normal jackal. In this form it will often run and hunt with jackal packs. Its second form is a six foot tall, half-human/half-jackal hybrid which stands erect. In its third form, the jackalwere is physically indistinguishable from normal human beings. The exact physical characteristics of the jackalwere's human form varies according to the desires of the monster.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

When the jackalwere locates a victim it will assume human shape and approach its prey. It will seek to ease the suspicions of its target, often pretending to be injured or otherwise in need, until it can employ its gaze attack. If this fails and the jackalwere is confronted with forceful resistance it will decide whether to flee or press the attack based on its estimation of its victim's strength.

The jackalwere spends its life hunting and killing any humans and demihumans it comes across. They roam the world in either the jackal or human form, seeking humanoids to kill, eat, and rob. They are sly creatures and masters of deceit.

Jackalweres are able to mate only in their jackal form. They may produce offspring either by mating with true jackals or other jackalweres, but only those young who were not of mixed blood will be jackalweres themselves. The children of a jackal and jackalwere mating will be jackals, although they will be unnaturally aggressive.

Female jackalweres give birth in five months to a litter of 1d4 pups. These are identical to jackal pups although they initially have 1 Hit Die. The pups grow quickly and add an additional Hit Die each year. Their jackal forms reach full growth at three years and pups are locked in that form for their first two years. At age two they gain the ability to assume their hybrid form and at age three they gain the ability to assume a human form which is apparently nine years of age. The human form grows at triple the normal human rate. If a parent in human form is discovered with its pups, it will often try to pass them off as pets.

Jackalweres may travel in the company of 1d6 normal jackals. Although these jackals are normal in every regard, the influence of the jackalwere tends to make them more fierce than normal. Jackals under the influence of a jackalwere will be hunters instead of scavengers.

ECOLOGY

Jackalweres will not serve any but the most evil of humanoids, and even then only if they have the opportunity to slay more humans and demihumans than they could on their own.

## Kenku

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-k/kenku-5e-stats/](Kenku)

DESCRIPTION

Kenku are bipedal, humanoid birds that use their powers to annoy and inconvenience the human and demihuman races.

The typical kenku resembles a humanoid crow wearing human clothing, but other shapes of kenku are known to exist. Kenku have both arms and wings. The wings are usually folded across the back and may be mistaken at a distance for a large backpack. Height ranges from 5 to 7 feet. The feathers are predominantly brown with white underfeathers and face markings. The eyes are a brilliant yellow.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Kenku are a secretive race that lives among the human and demihuman races without the bulk of the population ever being aware of their presence.

If a group of kenku is encountered, the group's size determines its composition. A group of five or fewer contains two 4-Hit Dice and three 5-Hit Dice kenku. A group of six or seven has a leader with 6 Hit Dice, three kenku with 4 Hit Dice, and the rest have 3 Hit Dice. A group of eight kenku adds a supreme leader of 7 Hit Dice.

Kenku do not speak; although they may give out bird-like squawks, these are gibberish. They are adept at symbols, sign language, and pantomime.

Kenku may appear to be friendly, helpful, and even generous. They freely give treasure to humans and demihumans, but it is rarely genuine and crumbles into dust within a day. They may offer nonverbal advice to humanoids, but this is carefully designed to mislead. It may actually lead the party into dangers and difficulties they might otherwise have avoided.

The actual structure of kenku society is elusive. The kenku themselves either refuse to comment or lie. Those kenku lairs that have been encountered tend to be small underground chambers or cave complexes. It is believed that large caverns deep underground may hold sizeable kenku communities, including individuals of 8 Hit Dice or more and with greater magical powers.

Kenku reproduction is similar to that of large birds. The female lays a clutch of two to four eggs that hatch after 60 days. New hatchlings are featherless, helpless, and have 1 hit point each. Hatchlings grow swiftly and gain 1 hit point each month. Within six to eight months they have adult feathers and are able to function independently as 1-Hit Die kenku. At this point they can begin to learn to use the skills they need as adults (thieving, fighting, disguise).

Younger kenku (3 Hit Dice or less) are reckless and prone to audacious plans. They have been known to pass themselves off as gods and collect the worshipers's offerings. Older kenku are more reserved and cunning, preferring to kidnap wealthy humans and demihumans as a source of revenue.

ECOLOGY

Domestically raised kenku are prized as servants. Kenku eggs are commonly sold for 250 gp, hatchlings for 300-500 gp. However, this is a form of slave trade, with all the attendant complications. If a kenku discovers captive kenku, it will attempt to secretly rescue the captive and, if possible, kidnap the slave trader or owner. They will avenge slain kenku.

## Kobold

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-k/kobold/](Kobold)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-kobold/](KOBOLD's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

Barely clearing 3 feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a bright red spark and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white.

Because of the kobolds' fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and

tenacity.

Kobolds speak their own language; some (75%) speak orc and goblin.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Kobolds live in dark, damp places underground and in overgrown forests. They can be found in almost any climate. As kobolds are good miners, any area with potential for mining is fair game for settlement.

The average kobold tribe has 40 – 400 (4d10x10) adult males. For every 40 kobolds in a band there will be one leader and two bodyguards. In a lair there will be 5-20 (5d4) bodyguards, females equal to 50% of the males, young equal to 10% of the males and 30-300 (3d10x10) eggs. There will also be a chief and 2-8 guards.

Further, there is a 65% chance there will be guard animals: (70%) 2-5 wild boars or (30%) 1-4 giant weasels. There may be one or more shamans.

Their society is tribal but can be further broken up into war bands based on specific clans. As many as 10 families can be part of a clan, and each clan usually is responsible for controlling the area in a 10 mile radius from the lair.

Kobolds recover treasure from the bodies of their victims and often carry them back to their lair as food. In some instances, kobolds will not kill their victims, but will sell them as slaves. Kobolds are distrustful of strangers.

They hate brownies, pixies, sprites and gnomes. Gnomes are never eaten or taken prisoner.

ECOLOGY

Perhaps kobolds are so cruel because they are easy prey for larger humanoids and hungry monsters. They have many enemies, and even the dwarves have had to admit that the numerous kobold-goblin wars have kept the number of goblins down to a safe level. Kobolds can live 135 years.

## Kobold Dragonshield

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-k/kobold-dragonshield-5e-stats/](Kobold Dragonshield)

DESCRIPTION

A kobold dragonshield is a champion of its race. Almost all dragonshields begin life as normal kobolds, then are chosen by a dragon and invested with great powers for

the purpose of protecting the dragon's eggs, but once every few years a kobold hatches with an innate version of the dragonshield's abilities. Accomplished at hand-tohand

combat, it bears many scars from desperate fights and carries a shield made out of cast-off dragon scales.

>***Weapon Invention.*** The kobold uses one of the following options (roll a 1d8 or choose one); the kobold can use each one no more than once per day:  
>**1- Acid. The kobold hurls a flask of acid.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) acid damage.  
>**2- Alchemist's Fire.** The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.  
>**3- Basket of Centipedes.** The kobold throws a small basket into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.  
>**4- Green Slime Pot.** The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined 5-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.  
>**5- Rot Grub Pot.** The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.  
>**6- Scorpion on a Stick.** The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
>**7- Skunk in a Cage.** The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can't take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn't need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.  
>**8- Wasp Nest in a Bag.** The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.  
>
>***Weapon Invention - Acid.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) acid damage.

## Kobold Inventor

DESCRIPTION

A kobold inventor, crafty and with quick hands, builds improvised weapons in the hope of gaining some new advantage in combat. An inventor captures bugs, scoops up exotic dungeon slimes, and claims the best stolen goods as ingredients in its experiments. Its creations are sometimes comical in appearance, but-like kobolds' traps- they work a lot better than their materials would suggest.

## Kobold Scale Sorcerer

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-k/kobold-scale-sorcerer-5e-stats/](Kobold Scale Sorcerer)

DESCRIPTION

A kobold scale sorcerer has an innate talent for arcane magic, making it a highly valuable member of the tribe for several reasons. Because the kobolds' deity remains imprisoned, most tribes lack individuals that can use divine magic, and so the scale sorcerers fill the roles of advisor and historian. In times of peace, they use their spells to fortify and enhance the warren and aid the rest of the tribe. When the tribe is threatened, a scale sorcerer lashes out with fire and poison against enemies, saving a bit of magic for itself in case it needs to flee or take advantage of a captor.

The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa's shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding.

DESCRIPTION

Kuo-toa are an ancient race of fish-men that dwells underground and harbors a deep hatred of surface dwellers and sunlight.

A kuo-toan presents a cold and horrible appearance. A typical specimen looks much like a human body, albeit a paunchy one, covered in scales and topped with a fish's head.

The huge fish eyes tend to swivel in different directions when observing an area or creature. The hands and feet are very long, with three fingers and an opposing digit, partially webbed.

The legs and arms are short for the body size. Its coloration is pale grey, with undertones of tan or yellow in males only. The skin has a sheen from its slimy covering.

The color darkens when the kuo-toan is angry and pales when it is badly frightened. A strong odor of dead fish follows it around.

It wears no clothing, only leather harnesses for its weapons and gear. Typically, a kuo-toan warrior carries daggers, spears, shields, harpoons and weighted throwing nets.

Kuo-toa speak the strange subterranean trade language common to most intelligent underworld dwellers. Additionally, they speak their own arcane tongue and have empathic contact with most fish.

Their religious speech is a corruption of the language used on the elemental plane of Water; if a kuo-toan cleric is in a group of kuo-toa, it is 75% unlikely that a creature native to the plane of Water will attack, for the priest will request mercy in the name of the Sea Mother, Blibdoolpoolp.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

These creatures normally travel in well-armed bands. If more than 20 kuo-toa are encountered, it is 50% likely that they are within 1d6 miles of their lair. For every four normal warriors encountered there is an additional fighter of 3rd or 4th level.

For every eight normal fighters there is an additional fighter of 5th or 6th level. For every 12 normal kuo-toa in the group there is a cleric/thief of 1d4+3 levels each. If more than 20 normal fighters are encountered, the group is a war consisting of the following:

One 10th-level fighter as Captain

Two 8th-level fighters as Lieutenants

Four 3rd/3rd-level fighter/thief Whips

One Monitor (see below)

One slave per four kuo-toa

Kuo-toa spawn as do fish, and hatchlings, or fingerlings as they call their young, are raised in pools until their amphibian qualities develop, about one year after hatching.

The young, now a foot or so high, are then able to breathe air and they are raised in pens according to their sex and fitness. There are no families, as we know them, in kuo-toan society.

Especially fit fingerlings, usually of noble spawning, are trained for the priesthood as priests, priest/thieves, or special celibate monks. The latter are called monitors whose role is to control the community members who become violent or go insane. The monitor is capable of attacking to subdue or kill.

Subdued creatures cannot be larger than eight feet tall and 500 pounds. Subduing attacks cause only half real damage, but when the points of damage inflicted equal the victim's total, the creature is rendered unconscious for 3d4 rounds.

Kuo-toan communities do not generally cooperate, though they have special places of worship in common. These places are usually for intergroup trade, councils, and worship of the Sea Mother, so they are open to all kuo-toa.

These religious communities, as well as other settlements, are open to drow and their servants, for the dark elves provide useful goods and services, though the drow are both feared and hated by the kuo-toa.

This leads to many minor skirmishes and frequent kidnappings between the peoples. The illithids (mind flayers) are greatly hated by the kuo-toa and they and their allies are attacked on sight.

The ancient kuo-toa once inhabited the shores and islands of the upper world, but as the race of mankind grew more numerous and powerful, these men-fish were slowly driven to remote regions.

Continual warfare upon these evil, human-sacrificing creatures threatened to exterminate the species, for a number of powerful beings were aiding mankind, their sworn enemies.

Some kuo-toa sought refuge in sea caverns and secret subter-ranean waters, and while their fellows were being slaughtered, these few prospered and developed new powers to adapt to their lightless habitat.

The seas contained other fierce and evil creatures, however, and the deep-dwelling kuo-toa were eventually wiped out, leaving only those in the underworld to carry on, unnoticed and eventually forgotten by mankind. But the remaining kuo-toa have not forgotten mankind, and woe to any who fall into their slimy clutches.

Now the kuo-toa are haters of sunlight and are almost never encountered on the earth's surface. This, and their inborn hatred of discipline, prevent the resurgence of these creatures, for they have become numerous once again and acquired new powers.

However, they have also become somewhat unstable, possibly as a result of inbreeding, and insanity is common among the species.

If a kuo-toan lair is found, it contains 4d10 x 10 2nd-level fighters. In addition, there are higher level fighters in the same ratio as noted for wandering groups. The leader of the group is one of the following, depending on the lair's population:

A cleric/rogue king of 12/14th level, if 350 or more normal kuo-toa are present

**or**

A cleric/rogue prince of 11/13th level, if 275-349 normal kuo-toa are present

**or**

A cleric/rogue duke of 10/12th level, if fewer than 275 normal kuo-toa are present.

There are also the following additional kuo-toa in the lair:

Eight Eyes of the cleric leader — 6th- to 8th-level cleric/rogue

One Chief Whip — 6th/6th-level fighter/rogue

Two Whips of 4th/4th or 5th/5th level (see whip description)

One Monitor per 20 2nd-level kuo-toa

Females equal to 20% of the male population

Young (noncombatant) equal to 20% of the total kuo-toa

Slaves equal to 50% of the total male population

In special religious areas there are also a number of kuo-toan priests. For every 20 kuo-toa in the community there is a 3rd-level priest, for every 40 there is a 4th-level priest, for every 80 there is a 5th-level priest, all in addition to the others. These priests are headed by one of the following groups:

One 6th-level cleric if the group is 160 or fewer

**or**

One 7th-level and one 6th-level cleric if the group is between 161 and 240

**or**

One 8th-level, one 7th-level, and one 6th-level cleric if the group numbers between 241 and 320

**or**

One 9th-level, two 7th-level, and three 6th-level clerics if the group numbers between 321 and 400

**or**

One 10th-level, two 8th-level, and four 6th-level clerics if the group numbers over 400

Though kuo-toa prefer a diet of flesh, they also raise fields of kelp and fungi to supplement their food supply. These fields, lit by strange phosphorescent fungi, are tended by slaves, who are also used for food and sacrifices.

Kuo-toan treasures tend more toward pearls, gem-encrusted items of a water motif, and mineral ores mined by their slaves. Any magical items in the possession of a kuo-toan are usually obtained from adventuring parties that never made it home again.

ECOLOGY

Not much is known to surface-dwelling sages about this enigmatic, violent, subterranean race, but some of the more astute scholars speculate that the kuo-toa are but one-third of the three-way rivalry that includes mind flayers and drow.

It is partially because of this continuing warfare that none of the three races has been able to achieve dominance of the surface world.

## Lizardfolk

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-l/lizardfolk/](Lizardfolk)

[https://angrygolem-games.com/fight-like-a-lizardman-aka-lizardfolk-to-include-the-shaman/](LIZARDFOLK's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

Lizardfolks are savage, semi-aquatic, reptilian humanoids that live through scavenging, raiding, and, in less hostile areas, by fishing and gathering. Adult lizardfolks stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weighing 200 to 250 pounds.

Skin tones range from dark green to gray to brown, and their scales give them a flecked appearance. Their tails average 3 to 4 feet long and are not prehensile. Males are nearly impossible to distinguish from females without close inspection. Lizard man garb is limited to strings of bones and other barbaric ornament.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Lizardfolks are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places, often (35%) dwelling totally under water in air-filled caves. A tribe rarely numbers more than 150 individuals, including females and hatchlings.

It is not uncommon for several tribes in an area to forge an informal alliance against outsiders, including other lizardfolk tribes. Lizard men are omnivorous, but are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.

In this regard they have been known to ambush humans, gather up the corpses and capture the survivors, and take the lot back to their lair for a rude and horrid feast.

[https://angrygolem-games.com/fight-like-a-lizardman-aka-lizardfolk-to-include-the-shaman/](LIZARDFOLK's TACTICS (read the article))

DESCRIPTION

A lizard king is a lizard man of above average height and intelligence, leading one or more loosely organized tribes of lizard men. The lizard king is most often armed with a great trident, which it wields with great skill and ferocity. If the attack roll is 5 or more greater than the score needed to hit, the lizard king inflicts double damage (with a minimum of 15 points).

A lizard king usually demands two humans each week. If no humans are available, demihumans and other humanoids will be sought. If none are available, two of the lizard king's bodyguards will be killed and eaten instead.

## Meazel

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-m/meazel-5e-stats/](Meazel)

DESCRIPTION

The meazel is a vicious, malevolent creature that preys on other subterranean dwellers or anyone else in the area. The meazel is slightly smaller than a human. Its skin varies in color from light gray to dark green. Most meazels (85%) have irregular patches of angry red color: these are the result of a noncontagious skin disease peculiar to meazels. The patches give the creature a leprous appearance. The eyes are jet black and the thick, waxy hair is dark green-gray The toes are partially webbed. Males and females are nearly identical.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

Meazels are hostile hermits, rarely encountered away from their lairs. They prefer marshes, caverns, or other cold, dark, dank places as sites to build their squalid homes. Such homes are appallingly dirty. Each meazel's possessions are gathered into a pile that also serves as the creatures bed. Rats and insects overrun the mess, polish off the leftovers, and also serve as snacks.

Only two things make meazels congregate willingly: the need for cooperation against a foe, and the infrequent urge to mate. Meazel females give birth to one or two whelps. The whelps are independent at three years and mature in six years. The whelps are incapable of being tamed even if captured at birth and raised in a kind environment, the whelps still grow malevolent although probably more intelligent and cunning.

Meazels are too mean-spirited to make reliable allies. However, they occasionally can he duped into acting as unwitting pawns or recruited against a common foe.

Meazels are greedy and will strip a corpse of anything they find valuable. However, they either do not understand or recognize magical items as valuable, hence such items are not generally found in meazel hoards. On the other hand, they might grab items that they are unable to use properly, such as human armor or large weapons. The bones of past meals are ofteb stored in sacks near the meazels' lair. The sacks also contain any gemy that the creatures may have found among their victims' possessions. Meazels do not recognize gems and semiprecious stones as treasure, hence they throw these away. Most of their treasure is coinage, silver and gold.

ECOLOGY

Meazels prey on anything that roams the subterranean realms. They are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh. Meazels prey mainly on orcs and kobolds, although they galdy attack anyone else who is available. Because of this, almost any subterranean dwellers attack a meazel on sight. Meazels are unique in that hatred of them unites virtually all other subterranean travelers.

## Merfolk

[https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-m/merfolk-5e-stats/](Merfolk)

DESCRIPTION

Merfolks are marine-dwelling, amphibious humanoids with the upper torso of a humanoid and the lower torso of a fish.

Merfolks were once human but were transformed by unknown powers into their current forms. They live by herding fish, but during times of need they attack other sea-peoples or ocean-going vessels. They live underwater but surface to sun themselves on large rocks.

Adult merfolks are 5 to 6 feet long (tall) and weigh between 150 and 225 pounds. Their skin tone is fair to tan, hair color is usually dark brown (occasionally fair), while their scale color ranges from green to silver. Females are 6 inches shorter than the males and weigh between 100 to 150 pounds. Merfolks adorn themselves with coral and shell decorations.

HABITAT / SOCIETY

For every 20 merfolks encountered, there is a patrol leader with 3 HD and 1d3 barracuda. For every 40 merfolks, there is a leader with 4 HD. For every 120 merfolks encountered, there is one chief with 6 HD and two guards with 4 HD. For every ten merfolks, there is a 10% chance of a shaman (3 HD, with the spells of a 3rd-level cleric).

Merfolks have regular undersea communities, usually a reef or cliff honeycombed with passages. Rarely they construct a village from sea shells and coral. An average community has between 100 and 600 males. Females and sub-adults each equal 100% of the males in a village. The communities are usually guarded by 3d6 trained **barracuda**s.

Merfolks society is heavily patriarchal. They prefer to be left to themselves and usually reject proposals of friendship or trade. They have strong territorial instincts and they have do not love surface dwelling humanoids. Males hunt and herd fish and protect their territory. Females raise children and tend to domestic affairs. Female merfolks are also known for their creativity, and they produce works of art for the community (shell carvings, seaweed tapestries, and songs).

ECOLOGY

Merfolks are omnivorous, but they prefer a diet of fish, lobster, crab, and shellfish. They do not cook these creatures, but must fillet them before eating. They can survive out of water for one hour before they begin to dehydrate. When dehydrated, they lose 2 hit points per hour and will die when they reach zero; immersion in fresh or salt water immediately restores these lost hit points.

Merfolks have an average life expectancy of 150 years.

Merfolks have many natural enemies but particularly hate the sahuagin and ixitxachitl. They often clash with tritons over territory.
